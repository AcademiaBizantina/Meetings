PL: Compiler Agnostic code in BSD world

Key Ideas:
  * Current OS code keeps the legacy of the compiler used to translate the code
  * This is translated as compiler dependent features and behaviours
  * BSDs need to think of a way to make their code as compiler dependent as possible
  * Or to think about the current approach of the programming language used
  * This can be useful for other projects as well, but on BSDs it's easier to test these concepts
